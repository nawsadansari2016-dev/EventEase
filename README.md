# EventEase

**Author:** Nawsad Ansari

EventEase is a small Blazor WebAssembly sample app designed for a course assignment. It demonstrates:
- Component scaffolding (Event model, Event list, Event card)
- Routing between pages
- Form validation with EditForm and DataAnnotations
- Simple registration and attendance tracking pages

## Setup (Visual Studio)
1. Extract the project folder.
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio (Open a project or solution -> select EventEase.csproj).
3. Restore NuGet packages and run the project (should run as a Blazor WebAssembly app).

## How Copilot assisted
Copilot helped scaffold components, suggested Razor syntax for two-way binding, recommended `DataAnnotationsValidator` for form validation, and provided ideas for state handling and navigation improvements.

## Notes
This is a simplified assignment-ready project. To make it production-ready, add persistent storage, authentication, and more robust state management.
